## 1. Background

MRTKLIB's SPP is a faithful port of RTKLIB 2.4.3 `pntpos.c`, living in
[`src/pos/mrtk_spp.c`](../../src/pos/mrtk_spp.c). It is a **per-epoch
weighted-least-squares (WLS) snapshot estimator** with these characteristics:

- `estpos()` — pseudorange WLS, state `x[NX]` = position(3) + 7 inter-system
  clock terms. **No state is carried across epochs**; the previous solution is
  only an iteration seed, not a covariance-weighted prior.
- `estvel()` / `resdop()` — **Doppler is already used** for a *separate*
  snapshot velocity solve (`x[4]` = velocity(3) + clock drift). It is not fused
  with position and does not smooth the position track.
- `varerr()` — **elevation-only** measurement weighting. SNR/C-N0 is used only
  for *masking* (`snrmask()`), never for weighting.
- `raim_fde()` — single-satellite fault detection/exclusion.
- No carrier-phase usage, no time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP), no
  carrier smoothing, no robust estimator, no clock-jump handling.

The consequence: a static SPP user gets the full per-epoch scatter (no
time-averaging at all), and a kinematic user gets a track that jumps whenever a
single pseudorange outlier slips through RAIM.

## 2. What "accuracy" means here (precision vs. bias)

The two halves of "accuracy" respond to *different* techniques. Conflating them
is the most common way to over-promise on this work.

| Aspect | Definition | What moves it |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **Precision** | epoch-to-epoch scatter / repeatability (RMS noise) | time-averaging (EKF), TDCP (position-domain carrier smoothing), Doppler velocity constraint |
| **Bias / accuracy** | offset of the *mean* position from truth | robust down-weighting of multipath/NLOS, C-N0 weighting, better atmosphere/ephemeris models |

**TDCP is a time difference**, so quasi-static systematic errors (fixed
multipath bias, ionosphere/troposphere residual, broadcast orbit/clock error,
code biases) cancel in the difference and carry *no* information to correct the
bias. TDCP therefore tightens the cloud but does not move its centre. Moving
the centre (especially for a static receiver) is the job of robust + C-N0
weighting. This is why the delivery order below leads with weighting, not EKF.

## 3. Scope

**In scope**

A **robust WLS front-end** that stays inside the existing snapshot estimator
(no architecture change):

- C-N0 (Sigma-ε) measurement weighting added to `varerr()`.
- IGG-III equivalent-weight robust re-weighting in the `estpos()` iteration.
- RAIM-FDE improvement (multi-fault, better exclusion thresholds).
- Doppler-based quality control (predicted-vs-measured consistency gating).

Then an **auxiliary TDCP relative-displacement constraint** (still
snapshot-coupled), and only after that an **optional, gated SPP-EKF**:

- TDCP used to tighten the velocity solve and to gate between-epoch jumps.
- Common-mode (all-satellite) receiver clock-jump correction + a logging /
  reset strategy (the prerequisite for a stable filter).
- An EKF for `PMODE_SINGLE` carrying position / velocity / acceleration /
  clock / clock-drift / inter-system bias states, with Doppler and TDCP fused.

Tooling:

- A `single` mode added to the PPC-Dataset benchmark for before/after metrics
  (P0, shipped).

**Out of scope** — external / post-processing / optional extensions, not the
SPP core:

- ML / NLOS classification (issue #116 priority 4).
- Factor-graph optimization (priority 3) — a batch / sliding-window optimizer
  that does not fit the streaming rtkrcv loop (see [§7](#7-real-time-considerations)).
- 3D-mapping-aided (3DMA) GNSS — requires an external building model.

## 4. Delivery order and rationale

A literature survey of SPP accuracy techniques (maintainer-local research
report; its findings are distilled in §2–4 and the references in §9, and the
work is tracked under [#116](https://github.com/h-shiono/MRTKLIB/issues/116))
ranks **TDCP-EKF first** for *kinematic impact* and *RTKLIB affinity*. That is
the single highest-ceiling lever and the architecturally correct estimator for a
real-time library — but it is not the right *first* step.

Two pieces of evidence reorder the work toward a **robust WLS front-end first,
EKF last**:

1. **The P0 baseline is outlier-dominated** ([§4.1](#41-p0-baseline-measured-2026-05-24)):
   in several runs `RMS 2D > p95`, so a handful of blunders dominate the error.
   The direct fix for that is robust weighting + fault exclusion, not a filter.
2. An independent design review (Codex) reached the same conclusion: land the
   improvements that drop into the existing WLS without breaking it
   (**SNR/C-N0 weighting, robust WLS, RAIM-FDE improvement, Doppler quality
   control**) first; introduce **TDCP as an auxiliary relative-displacement
   constraint** next; and only **EKF-ify after sufficient logging and a reset
   strategy exist**. FGO / ML / 3DMA are external/optional, not the core.

This also keeps risk monotonic: P1–P3 are confined to the snapshot WLS (no
state carried across epochs, so RTK/PPP seeding is unaffected in structure), and
the architecture change (the EKF) is deferred until the front-end is robust.
C-N0 weighting is additionally the cheap lever that moves **static bias**, which
the maintainer explicitly wants improved and which TDCP/EKF cannot.

| Step | Content | Architecture | Primary gain | Risk |
|------|---------|--------------|--------------|------|
| **P0** | `single` mode in PPC benchmark + baseline *(shipped)* | tooling | measurement harness | none |
| **P1** | C-N0 (Sigma-ε) weighting in `varerr()`, TOML-gated *(implemented)* | WLS | bulk (rate/median); defeats gate → §4.2 | low |
| **P2** | IGG-III robust re-weighting in `estpos()` (MAD scale) *(implemented)* | WLS | bulk (rate +11pp, median); defeats gate → §4.3 | low |
| **P3** | **Weighting-proof acceptance gate** (a-priori chi-square / covariance / RAIM integrity) — unblocks P1+P2's tail | WLS | **tail (p95/RMS), the dominant error** | medium |
| **P4** | TDCP auxiliary constraint: velocity tightening + between-epoch consistency / slip gating | WLS + light coupling | precision; jump rejection | medium |
| **P5** | Common-mode clock-jump correction + logging / reset strategy | infra | low-cost-receiver continuity; EKF prerequisite | medium |
| **P6** | SPP-EKF: coupled pos/vel/accel/clock + Doppler/TDCP, dynamics, reuse `rtk_t` | **EKF (new)** | kinematic smoothing / precision | medium |

Each step ships as an independent, reviewable commit, must pass the full
`ctest --output-on-failure`, and records numerical deltas (CLAUDE.md §7.2 —
tolerances are never silently changed).

### 4.1 P0 baseline (measured 2026-05-24)

The current SPP code path, measured on all six PPC-Dataset urban-driving runs
via the new `single` benchmark mode (config: [`conf/benchmark/single.toml`](../../conf/benchmark/single.toml)
— single-frequency L1, Klobuchar iono, Saastamoinen tropo, broadcast ephemeris,
elevation-only weighting, RAIM-FDE; first 60 epochs skipped for convergence):

| Case | N | mean nSV | <2 m | RMS 2D | 1σ (p68) | p95 |
|------|---|---------:|-----:|-------:|---------:|----:|
| nagoya_run1 | 5832 | 19.8 | 57.1% | 27.92 m | 3.31 m | 17.82 m |
| nagoya_run2 | 6101 | 20.5 | 56.9% | 11.12 m | 3.41 m | 20.30 m |
| nagoya_run3 | 4238 | 18.3 | 25.7% | 10.59 m | 12.15 m | 18.36 m |
| tokyo_run1  | 9435 | 20.7 | 33.0% | 11.59 m | 6.90 m | 24.41 m |
| tokyo_run2  | 8327 | 25.8 | 44.3% |  5.19 m | 3.91 m | 10.67 m |
| tokyo_run3  | 14265 | 27.0 | 30.1% | 36.02 m | 3.91 m | 14.69 m |

Reproduce:

```
python3 scripts/benchmark/run_benchmark.py \
  --dataset-dir <PPC-Dataset> --mode single --skip-download --skip-epochs 60
```

(The PPC-Dataset is downloaded manually — see
[`docs/reference/benchmark.md`](../reference/benchmark.md).)

**What the numbers say, and how it shapes the work:**

- **RMS is outlier-dominated.** In several runs `RMS 2D > p95` (run1: 27.9 m vs
  17.8 m; tokyo_run3: 36.0 m vs 14.7 m) — a handful of large blunders beyond the
  95th percentile dominate the RMS. This is exactly the snapshot-WLS
  position-jump vulnerability that robust down-weighting + fault exclusion
  (P2/P3) and temporal continuity (EKF, P6) target. Expect the biggest headline
  improvement from the robust WLS front-end.
- **Median accuracy is 3–12 m (p68).** Typical urban-canyon single-frequency
  SPP. Tightening this is the precision job of the EKF + TDCP.
- **~18–27 satellites tracked.** Ample redundancy for robust estimators and
  RAIM-style exclusion — the geometry is not the limiter; outlier handling is.

These six rows are the fixed before/after reference for P1–P6.

### 4.2 P1 result (C/N0 weighting, measured 2026-05-24)

P1 ([§5.8](#58-cn0-sigma-epsilon-weighting-p1)) was measured against the P0
baseline across a small `(snr_max, snr_error)` sweep (mean over the six runs):

| Setting | <2 m rate | RMS 2D | p68 | p95 |
|---------|----------:|-------:|----:|----:|
| P0 (off) | 41.2% | 17.07 m | 5.61 m | 17.71 m |
| (50, 0.5) | 44.1% | 17.05 m | 5.35 m | 18.44 m |
| (50, 0.3) | 42.8% | 17.00 m | 5.46 m | 18.29 m |
| (45, 0.3) | 42.1% | 17.06 m | 5.52 m | 17.99 m |
| (48, 0.4) | 42.9% | 16.97 m | 5.45 m | 18.38 m |

The pattern is consistent across every setting: C/N0 weighting **improves the
bulk** (fix rate +1–3 pp, median p68 slightly) **but worsens the p95 tail**
(+0.3–0.7 m). The mechanism is gate loosening — the additive SNR variance
inflates the per-epoch covariance, so the chi-square test in `valsol()` admits
more epochs (epoch count rises), and the newly-admitted marginal epochs land in
the tail. Per-run it is not uniform: a clear win on tokyo_run2 (<2 m
44.3 → 53.2%, p95 10.67 → 9.09 m) but a tail regression on nagoya_run1.

This is exactly the designed division of labour: **C/N0 weighting moves the bulk,
not the outlier tail** — the tail (the dominant P0 error) is the job of P2
(robust residual re-weighting) and P3 (RAIM). C/N0 weighting is therefore
**shipped but left default-off** (`snr_error = 0`) in [`single.toml`](../../conf/benchmark/single.toml);
the enable decision is deferred until P2/P3, after which P1+P2 are evaluated
together (the hybrid validated in Remote Sensing 12(16):2550).

### 4.3 P2 result and the gate-defeat finding (measured 2026-05-24)

P2 ([§5.6](#56-robust-estimation-p2-implemented-and-the-gate-defeat-finding))
adds IGG-III robust re-weighting. Mean over the six runs:

| Config | <2 m rate | RMS 2D | p68 | p95 |
|--------|----------:|-------:|----:|----:|
| P0 baseline | 41.2% | 17.07 m | 5.61 m | 17.71 m |
| P2 alone (k0=1.5,k1=4.0) | 47.6% | 21.35 m | 4.83 m | 30.82 m |
| **P1+P2 (1.5,4.0)+snr** | **52.5%** | 19.11 m | **4.30 m** | 27.30 m |

Robust + C/N0 weighting is a **large bulk win** (fix rate 41 → 52 %, median p68
5.61 → 4.30 m) but **blows up the p95 tail** (17.7 → 27 m). The per-run detail
identifies the mechanism precisely:

| Run | epochs N (P0 → P1+P2) | p68 | p95 |
|-----|----------------------:|-----|-----|
| tokyo_run2 | 8327 → 8505 (stable) | 3.91 → 2.19 m | 10.67 → **8.08 m** ✓ |
| tokyo_run3 | 14265 → 13933 (−) | 3.91 → 2.45 m | 14.69 → **14.15 m** ✓ |
| nagoya_run2 | 6101 → 8573 (**+40 %**) | 3.41 → 6.20 m | 20.30 → **56.13 m** ✗ |

**Where the epoch count N stays stable, P1+P2 is a clean win on every metric**
(tokyo_run2/run3: better rate, median, *and* tail). **Where N explodes, the tail
explodes with it** (nagoya_run2 +40 % epochs → p95 triples). The median improves
almost everywhere — the estimator genuinely produces better solutions.

The problem is therefore **not the estimator but the output gate**: the C/N0
variance inflation and robust down-weighting shrink the residuals that
`valsol()`'s chi-square test consumes, so the test stops rejecting the bad
epochs it used to catch (N rises) and those epochs land in the tail. The
weighting defeats the gate.

This precisely scopes **P3**: restore an acceptance gate that the weighting
cannot defeat (e.g. chi-square on a-priori variances, a formal-covariance /
post-exclusion-DOP integrity check, or proper RAIM protection levels). With the
gate restored, the tokyo_run2 result shows P1+P2+P3 should be a clean win across
the board. Until then P1 and P2 stay default-off.

## 5. Design

### 5.1 Architecture decision — reuse `rtk_t` for `PMODE_SINGLE`

The decisive finding is that the EKF infrastructure SPP needs already exists and
is already wired into the SPP code path:

- [`rtkpos()`](../../src/pos/mrtk_rtkpos.c) owns a **persistent `rtk_t`**
  (`rtk->x`, `rtk->P`, `rtk->ssat`, `rtk->tt`) across epochs.
- For `PMODE_SINGLE`, `rtkpos()` already calls `pntpos()` **with `rtk->ssat`**,
  so the per-satellite phase-history slots (`ssat.ph[]`, `ssat.pt[]`) used by
  TDCP are already reachable.
- The inter-epoch time delta `rtk->tt` is already computed.
- A constant-velocity / constant-acceleration position EKF (the kinematic
  dynamics model) already exists in [`udpos()`](../../src/pos/mrtk_rtkpos.c)
  (`NP(opt) = 9` when `dynamics != 0`), with its state-transition matrix.
- The Kalman primitives [`filter()`](../../src/core/mrtk_mat.c) and
  `smoother()` are battle-tested across PPP/RTK/VRS.

**Decision:** add an EKF path for `PMODE_SINGLE` inside `rtkpos()` that stores
state in the existing persistent `rtk_t`, reusing the `udpos()`-style time
update, `ssat` phase history, and `rtk->tt`. The snapshot `pntpos()` is **left
unchanged** because it is still the initial-position seed for RTK/PPP/PPP-RTK/VRS
([`mrtk_rtkpos.c` rover seed](../../src/pos/mrtk_rtkpos.c) and base seed). The
EKF is a parallel, gated path. The alternative — threading a new persistent SPP
state struct through `pntpos()`, `postpos`, and `rtksvr` — duplicates what
`rtk_t` already provides and was rejected.

> Note: the realtime helper SPP call in
> [`src/stream/mrtk_rtksvr.c`](../../src/stream/mrtk_rtksvr.c) passes
> `ssat = NULL`; it computes a throwaway base position, not the user solution,
> and stays on the snapshot path. Only the `rtkpos()` `PMODE_SINGLE` user
> solution is EKF-enabled.

### 5.2 State vector

SPP needs the receiver clock as a state (RTK differences it away), so the RTK
state layout is *not* reused verbatim — a dedicated SPP layout is defined:

```
x = [ rx ry rz | vx vy vz | ax ay az | cdt cddt | isb_glo isb_gal isb_bds3 ... ]
      position(3)  velocity(3)  accel(3)   clock+drift(2)   inter-system bias(NT-1)
                 (dynamics>=1) (dynamics==2)
```

- Velocity states exist only when `dynamics >= 1`; acceleration only when
  `dynamics == 2`. `dynamics == 0` ⇒ no kinematic states (degenerates toward
  snapshot, see [§6](#6-the-doppler-absence-invariant)).
- Inter-system biases reuse the seven-clock decomposition already in `estpos()`,
  modelled as random walks.
- Time update reuses the `udpos()` transition pattern (`F[i+(i+3)*nx]=tt`,
  optional accel coupling), with `cdt += cddt*tt`.

### 5.3 Pseudorange + Doppler measurement update

A single [`filter()`](../../src/core/mrtk_mat.c) update stacks all measurement
rows:

- **Pseudorange** rows constrain position / clock / ISB. The Jacobian and
  correction terms are lifted directly from
  [`rescode()`](../../src/pos/mrtk_spp.c).
- **Doppler** rows constrain velocity / clock-drift, lifted from
  [`resdop()`](../../src/pos/mrtk_spp.c) (existing, validated logic).

### 5.4 TDCP measurement update (P4 auxiliary, fused in the EKF at P6)

For each satellite continuously locked across `t-1 → t`, form
`Δφ = φ(t) − φ(t-1)`, predict the geometric increment from satellite motion and
the state, and add a residual row constraining velocity and the position
increment. Previous-epoch phase/time come from `ssat.ph[0][f]` / `ssat.pt[0][f]`,
which the SPP path must begin to populate (today only RTK/PPP do). TDCP delivers
the mm/s-class velocity constraint (van Graas & Soloviev 2004; Freda et al.
2015 — [§9](#9-references)).

### 5.5 Common-mode clock-jump correction (P5)

Low-cost receivers steer their clock, producing simultaneous millisecond jumps
on every satellite's carrier phase. `rescode()` already processes all visible
satellites in one pass, so the structural prerequisite is met. The added logic
estimates a single common ms step (median of per-satellite `Δφ`, in integer
multiples of `c × 1 ms`) and removes it from all satellites **before**
differencing — preventing the jump from being mistaken for per-satellite cycle
slips (Everett et al. 2022 / demo5 — [§9](#9-references)). It is a prerequisite
for stable TDCP on low-cost hardware.

### 5.6 Robust estimation (P2, implemented) and the gate-defeat finding

An IGG-III equivalent-weight (Yang et al. 2001) re-weighting pass is added to the
`estpos()` WLS Gauss-Newton iteration: each pseudorange row's weight is scaled by
a three-segment function `igg3_weight()` of its standardized residual, smoothly
down-weighting medium outliers (`k0<|r̃|≤k1`) and rejecting gross ones
(`|r̃|>k1`). The residual is standardized by a **MAD robust scale**
(`σ̂ = max(1, 1.4826·median|r̃|)`; Rousseeuw & Croux 1993, Huber 1981), so a
uniform mis-scaling of the a-priori variances does not trigger mass rejection.
It is applied from the 2nd iteration (`i≥1`), after the clock is estimated, and
only to the satellite rows (the rank constraints are left intact). Gated by
`[positioning] robust = "igg3"` with `robust_k0`/`robust_k1` (defaults 1.5/4.0);
`robust = "off"` (default) is bit-identical.

The benchmark ([§4.3](#43-p2-result-and-the-gate-defeat-finding-measured-2026-05-24))
shows this is a large bulk win that **defeats the chi-square gate** and inflates
the tail. That is the central finding: weighting (P1) and robust re-weighting
(P2) improve the solution but make `valsol()`'s residual-based test pass for
epochs it should reject. The fix is P3 (a weighting-proof acceptance gate), not
more estimator work. The same robust pass is later exposed in the EKF
measurement update (P6), giving the robust-WLS + TDCP-EKF hybrid validated in
Remote Sensing 12(16):2550 (2020).

### 5.7 Cycle-slip gating (P4 for TDCP auxiliary, reused at P6)

TDCP breaks on a single undetected slip, so detection is layered:

- `obs.LLI[]` loss-of-lock bits.
- Doppler-predicted vs. measured phase consistency (port/share
  [`detslp_dop()`](../../src/pos/mrtk_ppp.c) logic).
- Geometry-free phase jump (dual-frequency,
  [`detslp_gf()`](../../src/pos/mrtk_ppp.c) equivalent).

A satellite flagged as slipped drops only its TDCP row for that epoch; its
pseudorange row is still used. The existing `detslp_*` helpers are `rtk_t`-bound
file statics in [`mrtk_ppp.c`](../../src/pos/mrtk_ppp.c); sharing them with SPP
needs a small refactor to a common helper, designed at P4.

### 5.8 C/N0 (Sigma-epsilon) weighting (P1, implemented)

[`varerr()`](../../src/pos/mrtk_spp.c) gains an optional C/N0 term, identical in
form to the RTK `varerr()` ([`mrtk_rtkpos.c`](../../src/pos/mrtk_rtkpos.c)):

```
sigma^2 += (fact * err[6])^2 * 10^(0.1 * max(0, err[5] - CN0))
           err[5] = snr_max (dB-Hz),  err[6] = snr_error (m)
```

`err[5]`/`err[6]` were previously zero-initialised and unreachable from any
config; P1 exposes them as legacy options `stats-snrmax` / `stats-errsnr` and
TOML keys `[kalman_filter.measurement_error] snr_max` / `snr_error`, which also
makes the RTK engine's long-dormant SNR term configurable. The term is gated by
`err[6] > 0` (default 0 → off → bit-identical) and skipped when `CN0 == 0` so a
receiver that reports no C/N0 keeps the elevation-only model. The base
elevation/constant variance is untouched. See [§4.2](#42-p1-result-cn0-weighting-measured-2026-05-24)
for the measured effect and why it is shipped default-off.

## 6. The Doppler-absence invariant

**Hard design invariant** (testable acceptance criterion):

> When Doppler/TDCP are absent, the SPP solution is equivalent to the current
> WLS: bit-identical with the EKF gate off, and accuracy-equivalent with the
> gate on via the no-Doppler fallback.

This holds because Doppler and TDCP are **additive measurement rows, never
replacements** for the pseudorange path:

- Per-satellite absence is already handled — `resdop()` skips `D[0]==0.0`; the
  pseudorange row is unaffected.
- Whole-epoch absence ⇒ velocity states lose observability. Two safeguards:
  1. position process noise is set so an unobserved velocity prior cannot
     over-constrain position (the update degenerates to pseudorange-only ≈ WLS);
  2. a **safety valve**: if an epoch has zero Doppler *and* zero TDCP rows, that
     epoch falls back to the snapshot WLS solution (mirroring the
     `var > VAR_POS` reset already in [`udpos()`](../../src/pos/mrtk_rtkpos.c)).

**Verification:** the P0 benchmark is rerun on Doppler-stripped observations and
must reproduce the baseline metrics; this becomes a CI assertion.

## 7. Real-time considerations

No real-time concern:

- State dimension ≈ 17 (pos 3 + vel 3 + accel 3 + clock 2 + ISB 6).
  `filter()` is O(n³) but n=17 is negligible; ~30 measurement rows likewise.
- TDCP needs only the previous epoch (already in `ssat`), so it is naturally
  streaming; no batch buffering.
- rtkrcv already runs the far larger RTK/PPP EKFs in real time; the SPP EKF is a
  fraction of that cost.

This is also the positive argument for EKF over factor-graph optimization
(priority 3): FGO is a sliding-window batch optimizer that does not fit the
streaming `rtkrcv` loop, whereas the EKF is natively sequential. For a
real-time-capable library the EKF is the correct estimator.

## 8. Configuration (TOML gating)

Default behaviour is unchanged — every step is opt-in, so all existing tests
stay bit-identical:

- `[positioning] spp_filter = "wls" | "ekf"` (default `"wls"`).
- Reuse existing `pos1-dynamics` (0 none / 1 velocity / 2 accel) for the
  kinematic state selection.
- Sub-keys `spp_cn0_weight`, `spp_tdcp`, `spp_clkjump` to enable each step
  independently for staged rollout and ablation.

## 10. Open questions

- **Static accuracy truth.** PPC-Dataset is kinematic. Static bias improvement
  (P1) needs a known static coordinate validated against an IGS SINEX
  (epoch-propagated, not a station webpage coordinate).
- **`detslp_*` sharing.** Exact refactor to expose cycle-slip detection to SPP
  without disturbing PPP/RTK — settled at P4.
- **demo5 clock-jump parity.** Read the demo5 `pntpos.c` implementation before
  P5 rather than assuming behaviour (CLAUDE.md §3).
- **IGG-III thresholds.** The `k0`/`k1` segment thresholds need tuning against
  the P0 baseline; start from the literature range and validate per [§4.1](#41-p0-baseline-measured-2026-05-24).
